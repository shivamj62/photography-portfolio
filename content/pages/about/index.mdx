## About me
Hi, I'm Samarthya, a novice photographer with a passion for capturing the beauty around me. I started my journey in photography as a hobby, but soon discovered a deep love for it. As a novice, I'm constantly learning and growing in my craft, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.

My style of photography is still developing, but I'm drawn to capturing candid moments and natural beauty. I love exploring new locations, experimenting with different techniques, and finding new ways to tell visual stories through my images.

I may not have years of experience under my belt, but I approach every shoot with enthusiasm, dedication, and a desire to create images that make a statement.
